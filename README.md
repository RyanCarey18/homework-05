# Functionality

    The page loads when you open the url
    When you first load it should color coordinate based off of which hours are in the futre, present and past.
    There is an text box for every hour of the day to enter your plans into.
    If you type in the box and hit the save button it should save it to your local storage.
    Once you refresh it should repopulate the text boxes with the previous entries.

# Developement Process

    I developed the page starting with making sure the layout was good. Then I made the for loop to set the colors according to the time. After that I worked on how to save the text areas to local storage and how to pull them back from local storage.

# Usage

    To use the page just fill out any hours you have plans for than hit save. It will save your list.

# Technologies Used

    CSS (bootstrap)
    JS (moment, jquery)
    HTML

# Challenges Encountered

    I struggled on how to actually set a value to the local storage and replace them with new values and then pull those to the correct textarea.
